            <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
                <p> I have always wanted to learn how to code. It seems to me that if technology is forever going to be an intricate part of my life, I should know how it works. </p>
                
                <p>However, I was always more prone to the out-doors and less to computers. So throughout my time in high school and university this idea was always on the back burner, until I immigrated to Israel. </p>
                
                <p> After I fulfilled my obligatory army service, I fully comprehended the extent that my lack of fluency in Hebrew would affect my professional prospects. I started reconsidering how I could support a family and find a profession. </p>
            
                <p>At first, the idea of being a tour guide was very appealing. It appealed to my fondness of the out doors and took advantage of my native languages (Spanish and English). However after i completed the two year course to become a licensed tour guide, Covid-19 hit. The tourism industry was crippled and most tourists were barred from entering the country. </p>
            
                <p> I continued my day job in security in my town of Itamar, until it dawned on me that now would be the perfect time to explore coding. I realized that I was in a golden situation. I have a flex hour job to pay the bills while i study, and I can use my new skills to transition out of security and into a new and promising profession. This was a no brainer.
                </p>
            <h2>Job History</h2>
                <p> Throughout my time in America and in Israel I held a wide assortment of jobs. In America, I worked in small motor repair, as a Martial Arts Instructor, head of sales and inventory for a retail store. In Israel, my first job after the army was as an agricultural worker/ factory worker for the olive oil company Meshech Ahiya. As i started studying part time for my tour guides license, I transitoined to Town security. This was a very rewarding job in that everyday i felt if i did a good job i was keeping my neighbors safe from terrorism. Very soon i learned the code of security is "only work in security if you are improving yourself professionally at the same time. Otherwise this job will eat you alive". Once I got my license as a tour guide I started transitioning out of security, right when Israel entered its first nation wide quarantine. Thank God, I had an "essential" job and was able to work fulltime through every quarantine. It become quite clear to me that the blow to the tourism industry was more devastating than the government or most tour guides were willing to admit. The industry was set back atleast 15 years from where it was pre Covid-19.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> During Covid-19 I took full advantage of the rural landscape where Itamar is situated. I taught my kids about hiking, navigating, and gardening. We spent much of our time going on nature walks and hikes.
